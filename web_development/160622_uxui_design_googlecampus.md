# Google UX / UI Design by Jacob Chalkley (Google Interaction Designer)
## 1
- Is the user able to complete the task as they intended?
- Is ~ as the designer intended?
- Is the user satisfied with completing the task as the designer intended?

## 2
- (Who) is using ur website?
- (When) are they using their website?
- (Why) are they using the website?

## 3 Critical User Journeys
- Navigating to a local store by using Google Products and try to figure out if the UI & UX are useful for users.

## Future trends
- (Audience) Voice Commands (get rid of unnecessary steps to get to where they want to go to)
- The Returns of Texture
  - Less flat colors
  - More teture to give the surface a "feeling"
  - Universal Lighting
- Less Siloed Apps (more like integration of multiple apps)
  - Less single use apps
  - More "Assistant" apps and integration with other apps
  - Think "Critical User Journeys"
  - (my opinion) toward simplyfying the funtions and making it lighter than its supposed to be
- Internet of Things
  - What does a Graphic User Interface look like for the IOT?
  - How do you connect multiple devices together with a single User Interface?
- More Sharing
  - Less Individual devices
  - More sharing of devices and loaning them out to family members and strangers
